            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Luis Infante and I am on the path to becoming a web developer. While it is not my goal in life to be a web developer, I am working on it as a stepping stone to becoming a multi-skilled programmer.</p>
            <p>My goal in life is to achieve greatness through any means possible, and I've decided that learning how to program is how I am going to start my journey towards my goal (pretty cocky right?).</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>Why create this website? I am doing the Full-Stack Engineer course at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and this is a sort of final project for one of the modules of the course.</p>
            <p>This project should show a bit of what I have learned so far regarding HTML, CSS, and JS.</p>
            <div>
                <h3>Project 1: <a href="https://lain-21.github.io/c_Number_Guesser/" target="_blank">Number Guesser</a></h3>
                <p>Before you get too excited, no, I didn't do the HTML or CSS for this website, only the JS. The JS included the score counters, the calculations to determine the winner and other things I can't really remember right now.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Project 2: <a href="https://github.com/LAIN-21/c_Card_Checker" target="_blank">Card Checker</a></h3>
                <p>This project isn't as pretty as the last one due to having no HTML whatsoever, but in all honesty, it was more fun to do. Github copilot and I formed a fantastic duo getting this one done. The program in essence takes different arrays of card numbers and sorts them in terms of being valid or not. Validity of the card was determined by different algorithms.</p>
                <p id="clickhere">If you click this sentence I'll tell you the algorithms</p>
                <p id="algorithms">No, I'm not going to tell you the algorithms, look them up. Kinda silly for you to think I would do that for you.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Project 3: <a href="https://github.com/LAIN-21/c_Mixed_Messages" target="_blank">Mixed Messages</a> </h3>
                <p>What a useless project right? Well this was my own original idea of course. Just a cute little program that returns random sentences from different combinations of word arrays.</p>
                <p>Don't be such a hater JEEZ!</p>

            You seriously thought I was going to drop my info like that? <br>
            Just kidding, you can have my <a href="https://github.com/LAIN-21" target="_blank">github</a>.<br> <br>
            That's it, that's the end of the website.<br>
            I gave up on the CSS, that's what wix is for who cares tbh.<br><br>
            PS: I hope you didn't realize how I was hiding my poor coding skills behind comedy.<br>
